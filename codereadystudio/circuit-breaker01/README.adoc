= Circuit Breaker - Spring Boot Example Application

IMPORTANT: This runs best when deployed to OpenShift in order to use the circuit breaker functionality. For more details on using this example application with a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This example application requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x or greater.



== Running the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your example application there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your example application to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Log in and create your project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ unzip booster.zip

$ cd booster

$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

== Interacting with the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

To interact with your example application while it is running on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster, you first need to obtain its URL:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route springboot-cb-greeting -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

springboot-cb-greeting-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME

$ oc get route springboot-cb-name -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

springboot-cb-name-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME
----


You can use the form at your application's URL or you can use the `curl` command:


[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://springboot-cb-greeting-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "fail"}' http://springboot-cb-name-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/state

$ curl http://springboot-cb-greeting-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, Fallback!"}

$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "ok"}' http://springboot-cb-name-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/state

$ curl http://springboot-cb-greeting-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
